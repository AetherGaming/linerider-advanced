1.01 -> 1.02
Added new predictive camera. Try it out, tell me what you think. It's beyond experimental and subject to change.

Smooth playback! Same LR you know and love at a silky smooth 60+ fps. As mhenr mentioned this doesn't play well with animation.

Rider border changed to be thicker. It seemed... hard to follow high movement tracks. This seems to help.

Recording crash (potentially) fixed

Files now saved to ~/Documents/LRA instead of the executable directory

Auto-check for updates that can be disabled

Playback skipping with left/right arrows now plays music to aid with syncing (late to the party)

Rewrote audio backend.

Multiline tool cap raised to 9999 from 50. It was there just because I thought nobody would need more than 50 (lol) and i didnt want people crashing their games.
